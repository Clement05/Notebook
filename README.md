# Notebook

This is a notebook for home automation (at the moment).

It is personal notes that might be useful for others.

Hardware: Raspberry Pi 2B OS Raspbian

Agenda:
- Create an API with FLASK/Gunicorn/Nginx
- Create a call to the netatmo API (expected)
- Create a Docker Container for apps portability (expected)
